    <h1>Bio — A Self Thesis</h1>

    <p>I study clarity in creators. My work started when I noticed two patterns: the loud creators who had no direction and the quiet creators who had no audience. The bridge between them is identity — not tactics.</p>

    <h2>What I do</h2>
    <p>I run public experiments with creators. I isolate their identity signals, design simple repeatable systems, and document outcomes in a way clients can replicate. The result is not vanity growth — it is qualified attention that turns into opportunities.</p>

    <h2>Where this came from</h2>
    <p>I built my practice running experiments on myself — changing voice, format, and distribution for months and measuring only the outcome that mattered: alignment between the work and the audience who responds to it.</p>

    <h2>Who I work with</h2>
    <p>Founders, independent creators, consultants who have something real to say but lack clarity in how they say it. I don't work with projects looking for short term virality. I work with people who want durable influence.</p>

    <h2>Why it works</h2>
    <p>Systems amplify identity. When identity is specific, audiences self select. When audiences self select, offers convert with less noise and less marketing. This is leverage. This is the thing clients pay for.</p>

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarity over opinion</li>
      <li>Experiment over speculation</li>
      <li>Proof over projection</li>
    </ul>
