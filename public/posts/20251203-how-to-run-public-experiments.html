    <h1>How to Run Public Experiments That Build Trust</h1>

    <p>Public experiments are a brand's laboratory. They are faster than case studies and more credible than promises. Follow four rules.</p>

    <h2>Rule 1 — Make the metric meaningful</h2>
    <p>Pick one metric that matters to clients. Vanity metrics hide poor outcomes. Choose something that indicates value, for example "conversations that mention budget" or "email replies asking about process".</p>

    <h2>Rule 2 — Limit variables</h2>
    <p>Change one thing per experiment. If you change voice and distribution at the same time, you won't learn which tweak mattered.</p>

    <h2>Rule 3 — Publish the log</h2>
    <p>Short daily notes: what you tried, what you measured, what happened. Logs are shareable microproof that build narrative and trust.</p>

    <h2>Rule 4 — Extract lessons</h2>
    <p>After the window, write a short essay with findings and practical steps. This becomes evergreen article material.</p>

    <p><strong>CTA:</strong> I run experiment audits. If you want an audit of your last month, send three links and I'll answer with three concise actions. Email hi@youremail.com.</p>
