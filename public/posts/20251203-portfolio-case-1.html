    <h1>Portfolio Case — Identity Rebuild for a Creator</h1>

    <p>Before: scattered advice, broad audience, low conversion. After: niche identity, aligned offers, higher quality leads.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Audit existing content and identify recurring themes.</li>
      <li>Choose the identity anchor (example: "Content systems for B2B founders").</li>
      <li>Reformat posts to show process, not tips. Add a direct CTA for discovery calls.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Three months later the creator had a pipeline of three paid projects and a clear case study to show. The conversion rate on outreach messages rose from 2 percent to 12 percent.</p>

    <h2>Takeaway</h2>
    <p>Clarity increases conversion. Specificity filters the wrong viewers and draws the right ones closer.</p>
