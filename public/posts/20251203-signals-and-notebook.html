    <h1>Signals — The Notebook of Micro Insights</h1>

    <p>Micro notes are the food for experiments. Keep five short signals every day: one observation, one question, one failure, one small win, one idea to try.</p>

    <h2>How to use this notebook</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Collect: Save short items when they occur.</li>
      <li>Cluster: Weekly, group similar notes into a theme.</li>
      <li>Publish: Turn the cluster into one experiment or one essay.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Signals are small. Systems turn them into output. Keep both honest.</p>

    <p><strong>CTA:</strong> Reply with one short signal and I will suggest one experiment idea you can run this week. Email hi@youremail.com.</p>
