    <h1>The Great Experiment — A Manifesto for Creators</h1>
    <p>Most advice for creators starts at the tail: tactics, hacks, metrics. The Great Experiment starts at the head — identity. This manifesto is a single proposition: experiment publicly, measure truthfully, change your identity on purpose.</p>

    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>Creators chase output. They copy formats that worked for someone else. They become louder, not clearer. Traffic follows noise in the short term. Direction is missing. Identity vanishes. Growth becomes brittle.</p>

    <h2>The hypothesis</h2>
    <p>If you treat your public work as experiments controlled by a clear identity, results scale and conviction grows. Identity shapes what you create; what you create shapes who notices you; who notices you shapes opportunity.</p>

    <h2>The four pillars</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Identity</strong> — defined, verbalised, tested in public.</li>
      <li><strong>Direction</strong> — a single north star that filters decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Execution</strong> — repeatable systems that produce signal, not noise.</li>
      <li><strong>Proof</strong> — documented outcomes, not vanity metrics.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to run an experiment</h2>
    <p>Pick one behavior change. Make a measurable outcome. Run it for a fixed window. Record everything. Publish the logs. Learn and repeat.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Hypothesis: Posting identity anchored posts three times a week increases qualified inbound queries. Metric: number of message threads that mention clarity or identity (not likes). Run time: 6 weeks.</p>

    <h2>When to stop an experiment</h2>
    <p>If it does not move the chosen metric in the expected direction after the test window, iterate. Never keep a failing experiment because you are attached to the idea.</p>

    <h2>Why publish in public</h2>
    <p>Public experiments force precision. Audience feedback is raw. It reveals gaps faster and builds trust through transparency.</p>

    <h2>Commitment</h2>
    <p>I will publish experiment notes, results, and failures. I will not defend past approaches. I will value clarity over charisma. If you want to be led by a theory, find someone else. If you want to be guided by lived results, stay.</p>
