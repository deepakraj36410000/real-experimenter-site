    <h1>Client Magnet — How I Turn Experiments into Paying Clients</h1>

    <p>Clients do not buy content. They buy predictable outcomes. A client magnet is a predictable set of signals, proof, and a simple path to hire you. Here is the system.</p>

    <h2>Signal</h2>
    <p>Your signal is the identity you publish. It must be narrow and repeated.</p>

    <h2>Proof</h2>
    <p>Proof is public experiments, case studies, and consistent logging of results. One strong case study is worth ten vague testimonials.</p>

    <h2>Path</h2>
    <p>Make the path to hire obvious: a single CTA that leads to a discovery conversation. Reduce friction. The CTA should ask them for one clear piece of information that qualifies them.</p>

    <h2>System</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Publish 3 experiments per month</li>
      <li>Package one experiment per quarter into a case study</li>
      <li>Use one CTA only — "Start your experiment" — and link it to an email or simple form</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>CTA:</strong> Want a free short audit for fit? Email hi@youremail.com with "Audit: Client Magnet".</p>
