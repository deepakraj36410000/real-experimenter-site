    <h1>Identity Experiment 01 — From Noise to Signal</h1>

    <p>Experiment summary: Over six weeks we narrowed a creator's voice to two themes instead of ten and switched the CTA from "follow" to "message about clarity". Outcome: fewer followers but a 4x increase in qualified client leads.</p>

    <h2>Step 0 — The diagnosis</h2>
    <p>The creator posted random tips across marketing, lifestyle, and productivity. Engagement was spread but meaningless. People liked but did not hire.</p>

    <h2>Step 1 — Pick a north star</h2>
    <p>We chose "identity systems for early stage creators". Every post had to pass the test: does this teach identity or is it distraction?</p>

    <h2>Step 2 — Reformat for proof</h2>
    <p>Each week we published one short case note, one thread that documented a micro experiment, and one reflective essay. Each post ended with one invite: message me about your identity problem.</p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>Engagement dropped 20 percent, reach remained flat, but messages that asked about clarity and budgets increased 4x. The creator closed two projects in month two.</p>

    <h2>Lesson</h2>
    <p>Audience that converts is narrower and clearer than an audience that applauds. Trade applause for alignment.</p>

    <p><strong>CTA:</strong> If you want a short audit of your identity signals, email hi@youremail.com with the subject "Identity Audit".</p>
